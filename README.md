# wikipicturegame
A game of "guess which Wikipedia page this image appears on".  You can find the app online here: http://wikipicturegame.herokuapp.com.  Images and links are accessed via the Wikipedia API: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.

To run the project, make sure to set up a virtualenv using my requirements.txt file.  You will need to set the following environmental variables:

WIKIPICTUREGAME_DB_USER,

WIKIPICTUREGAME_DB_PASSWORD,

WIKIPICTUREGAME_SECRET_KEY,

WIKIPICTUREGAME_DEBUG
